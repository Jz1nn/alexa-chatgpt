# Amazon Echo
- I recently purchased an Amazon Echo Assistant. However, with daily use, I identified some inconsistencies, errors in responses, incomplete responses and failure in sequential commands. As with my other electronics, as soon as I identify a possible improvement/fix, I like to upgrade. I had the idea to insert ChatGPT from the openAI company as an auxiliary assistant.

# How to use:
- Say the nickname you set to activate your amazon device.
- Say the skill activation word: 'open chat' (it's in portuguese because it's my local language).
- Ask your question and the chatbot will do its job.

# How it works:
- When your question is asked, the GPT-3.5 Turbo API will be used to answer your question. It's simple! :)
